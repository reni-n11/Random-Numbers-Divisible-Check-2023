# Random Numbers Divisible Check (2023)
A simple Python program in Bulgarian I created in university for generating random numbers and then checking if they are divisible by a number that the user inputs.
# Features
1. The user is prompted to enter the number of numbers to be randomly generated. If the number is not an integer, an error message shows up.
2. The user is prompted to enter the number that will be the divisor. If the number is not an integer, an error message shows up.
3. There are two lists, one for the generated numbers and one for the numbers divisible by the divisor.
4. The lists get turned into arrays before being printed.
5. The array of all generated numbers is printed.
6. If there are no numbers divisible by the divisor, there is a message.
7. If there are numbers divisible by the divisor, their array is printed.
